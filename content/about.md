I'm just an ordinary guy who loves building things. Ever since I was a kid, I've been fascinated by technology and how it can make people's lives better. I still remember taking apart my first computer just to see how it worked inside - my parents weren't too happy about that!

As I got older, I knew I wanted to turn my passion into a career in software engineering. I studied computer science in college and was always excited to work on group projects, hackathons, and anything that let me flex my coding skills.  

After graduation, I started my professional journey at a startup building large-scale distributed systems. It was exciting to see my code go live and be used by thousands of people! Of course, things didn't always go smoothly - late nights debugging complex problems taught me a lot about resilience.

These days, I work on crafting robust backend infrastructure and services. I love optimizing for performance and high availability. Outside of work, I dabble in side projects across web, mobile, and AI. Turns out you can build some pretty cool things with just a laptop and internet connection! 

On my blog, I hope to share my adventures in technology, as well as chat about other topics I enjoy like economics, philosophy, and ways we can leverage tech for social good. I'm far from an expert, but writing helps clarify my own thinking. Hopefully you'll find it interesting too!

Let's see where this journey takes us next. Thanks for reading!
